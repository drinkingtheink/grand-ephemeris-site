Retrieved from the Library of Congress.\nApollo went down to Nashville\nThought he'd give it all a go\nHe sang his way all over Ancient Greece\nHow bad could it be on music row?\nBut the doors they just kept shutting\nAnd his phone just wouldn’t ring\nNashville just didn’t want him\nNo matter how well he could sing\nSo Apollo got to planning, got to pooling capital\nSaid 'I'\ll sink my shine into sound-proof walls and microphones of gold.'\nHire ourselves the finest engineers, Gods and Goddesses of taste\nThen we\'ll sign the finest talent, crown some kings, radiate\nApollo just didn’t\nUnderstand what could go wrong\nSuch a long way from Olympus with a guitar and a song\nElvis, Icarus, the Man in Black, Jerry Lee Lewis\nCarl Perkins Cadillac led him to the feet of the Son of Zeus\nHades sitting in on drums, keep the souls in check, keep the rhythm stable\nFly as close as you can to the sun\nLet your wax wings melt on the spinning turntable\nApollo went and did it\nProduced a stunning catalog\nSuch a long way from Olympus with a guitar and a song";
