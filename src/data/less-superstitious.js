const ls = "Three days ago was a quarter past time to talk about it\nYour legs are already walking down\nBut fuck it all and burn the miles, I've got a lighter\nAnd nothing to do at home\nAnd you know I'm not religious\nI'm even less superstitous about\nLadders or cracked mirrors, black cats in my stride\nI\'ve known them all since I was a child\nI bit my tongue and rolled around\n'Are you there? I had a dream.'\nIt was a cracked door, a humming sound, rounds in all directions\nAnd just a sign pointing back at me\nAnd you know I'm not uncivil\nBut I\'m concerned about the frequenecy of the visits\nFrom ladders or cracked mirrors, black cats in my stride\nI wish they\'d talk back every once in a while"
