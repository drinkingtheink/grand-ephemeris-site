const tlp = "I'm fired like a shotgun, and high as a brain wave\nThe part at which it peaks when someone says your name\nWe're all just objects dancing through time and space\nWith just my mind I can move them and I can levitate\nI don't even have to think about it, it kind of happens on a whim\nSometimes embarrassing, I've done it by accident\nI can't explain how it happens, don't blame you for giving doubt\nAll I need's a little pratice, maybe then I can show you how\nI don't even have to pray, just clap my hands and sing all day\nKeep my spirits so high, up til it flies away\nHands steady as a surgeon, you can't knock me off my game\nNo matter how sharp your English, I still keep perfect aim\nThe past presents the future, to me it looks all the same\nI usually know what will happen, I usually see it in my dreams\nDon't even bother trying to figure it out, when I was working for the police\nHow I cracked those cold case files on my own overnight\nI don't need the cards, your palm or the stars\nI see the future in your eyes\nThe way you walk and talk, your actions in the dark\nAdding up to a big surprise\nOn fire like a falling star and high as a brain wave\nThe part at which it peaks when someone says your name\nWe're all just animals, dancing with tiny brains\nDissecting this experience\nDon't believe a word they say, that reading fortunes brings the same\nIt just diludes the experience\nI think I'd be better off not knowing when my friends will die\nNot knowing how or why"
