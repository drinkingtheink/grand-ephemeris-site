St. Helens, she woke up and swallowed the West Coast\nAnd she shed her lumber and poured down Sierra's Throat\nAnd she won't give it back until something upsets her and then where will we go?\nI\'ve got a good vessel, I think I\'ll just sail West of here\nAnd if the world\'s flat I\'ll write or buy you a souvenir\nThey have the best truck stops just outside the atmosphere\nYou get to barter for price\nAnd I heard Atlantis he just lost his confidence\nNo social insecurity but unusual circumstance\nHe wanted to stay up but his villagers outvoted him\nThey were ready to go\nAnd we\'ve got our hopes so high\nWe\'ve got our hands so sleight\nWe\'ve got our lips wrapped tight\nAround whatever we want"
